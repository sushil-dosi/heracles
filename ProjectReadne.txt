Will be using Java webservice to make this Project

For UI will use Swagger so I don't have to worry about creating HTML page or JS as
I will be taking care of most stuff in java side.

I used intellij as an IDE and maven as build tool. Also included few screen shot and screen recording of project

HOW TO RUN
If you import the application in any java ide and run the Main file navigate to
following url in the browser

localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html#!

Click on Main Controller

in the input box enter the value and click try it out button

Response body section should have the response (result or error)


TESTING
I have tested Controller as just happy path test by mocking the webservice

And tested service with multiple test cases -
Null value
Empty value
Simple number
Long number
number with decimal
Negative Numbers
Simple string
String with special characters
String number mixed etc




JENKINS
We can hook this project to CI/CD pipeline like Jenkins by defining our jenkins file
we can define the repository to pull project from and set to build project and run our unit test on each commit or whatever is desired.
and even deploy it to EC2 or something similar
